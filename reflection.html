        For my final project I am going to do a data visualization showing both the education 
        rates and average policy party per each county in the US and how it has changed over time. 
        (I’m not saying that these two statistic are directly correlated, but do with the findings what you may…) 
        I plan to make this visualization an interactive map on a website. On this site you can either look at just 
        education rates, just average policy parties, or both simultaneously. You will be able to choose which year you 
        want to look at (based on the datasets I have found thus far it will be from 1970 to 2022). In terms of viewing 
        the numbers, you can scroll over each state with your mouse to find the state average, but you can also click on 
        a state to zoom in where you can see each county. For the political party, the map will have a red and blue color
        gradient and the education percentages will have a different color way that I am not sure on yet. I haven’t figured 
        out the best way to visually display both political party and education level at the same time, so I am open to 
        suggestions on that front.

        Here is a list of what I plan to show (in no specific order):

        Years for all visualizations: 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2008-2012, & 2018-2022
